CODEX RULES AND CODEBASE STRUCTURE

📜 RULES FOR CODEX

1. This file must always be kept UPDATED.
   - Any time a new script is created, renamed, or removed, Codex should update this file.
   - Any time a script’s **purpose** or **connections** change, update its description.

2. This file serves as a LIVE MAP of the codebase.
   - Codex should read from this to understand structure instead of scanning everything.
   - Codex should write to this to reflect the latest structure after code changes.

3. This is the central record for:
   - Script names and locations
   - Their purpose
   - What other modules they call or interact with
   - Their current state (working, stub, needs update, etc)
